# PyLeetCode üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª
- This repo is a curation of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) Problems which I solve occasionaly.
- The solutions are primarily in Python
- You can use this as a refernce for your Interview Prep Journey or in general problem solving
- Currently availabe:[38](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyProjectEuler/tree/master/solutions) Problems

# Note:
- I have tried to obtain the best solutions for each of the problems
- Yet there might be ones which are much more efficent in terms of space and time complexity or even brevity of code
- Feel free to add your own!

# Problems: üìö

| Questions | Solution(s) |
| --------- | --------- |
|[1.Multiples of 3 and 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)| [Solution](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/PyProjectEuler/blob/master/solutions/1-multiples-of-3-and-5.py) | 




# Disclaimer: ‚ùó
- I don't own or am the creator of any of the problems.
- Please refer to the official [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) website for any futher details

## Further work:
- Complete all Easy Problems
- Have detailed explanations along with the code
- Do time and spacy complexity analysis of each
- Start implementing Medium Problems

# Other places to practice from(Scripts coming up post summer):

# Challenge! ‚öî
- If you dare then take up the #100DaysofCode Challenge on Twitter and solve 4-5 problems everyday!
- Believe me in no time, you would have solved all the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
